# Recon

Your Personal Shield Against "He Said, She Said."

Ever reported a critical bug, only to be told weeks later that it "slipped through the cracks"? Are you tired of the blame game during crunch time, where verbal agreements and scattered notes aren't enough to prove what was said?

Recon is a personal defect and accountability tracker built for the tester on the front lines. It's designed to be your single source of truth a private, undeniable log of every bug, every conversation, and every decision. Stop relying on memory and start relying on data.

## The Core Problem

In fast-paced teams without a centralized project management tool, vital information gets lost.

- Verbal commitments from developers are forgotten.
- Key decisions made in passing are never documented.
- The burden of proof falls unfairly on the tester.

## Recon was built to solve this

### Features

Recon is more than just a notebook. It's a professional-grade tool designed for speed and clarity.

- **Detailed Defect Tracking**: Log bugs with all the critical fields: Severity, Priority, Status, Assignee, Environment, Steps to Reproduce, and more.

- **The Sacred Timeline**: The killer feature. For every bug, Recon creates a stunning, interactive timeline. Each conversation and decision is a timestamped event, creating a visual history of the bug's life.

- **Nexus Events**: Flag critical updates (like a "Won't Fix" decision) as "Nexus Events." These visually branch off the main timeline with a vibrant, warning glow, ensuring they can't be missed.

- **Tap-to-Reveal**: The timeline is clean and visual. Simply tap on any event dot or nexus branch to reveal the full details in a tooltip.

- **Offline First**: Built with a local-first database, Recon is incredibly fast and works perfectly with or without an internet connection. Your data lives securely on your device.

### Who is Recon for?

- QA Testers & Engineers in teams that lack formal tracking tools.

- Developers who want a personal log to track bugs they've been assigned.

- Project Managers in small teams who need a lightweight way to keep a record of issues.

### The Roadmap

Recon is actively being developed. Here's what's coming next:

[ ] **Bug Export**: Export bug lists to CSV or PDF for reports.

[ ] **Image & Video Attachments**: Add visual proof to timeline events.

[ ] **Reminders & Notifications**: Get notified about upcoming deadlines.

[ ] **Cloud Sync** (Optional): A future option to back up your data to the cloud.

Built with ❤️ using **React Native**, **Expo**, **SQLite** and **Skia**.
